# 21Hash

**21Hash** is an open-source AI assistant designed to support and strengthen the global Bitcoin mining community—from industrial-scale farms to solo pleb miners.

It learns from manuals, logs, config files, and community input to help:
- Troubleshoot mining hardware and firmware
- Optimize energy use and configurations
- Share heat reuse strategies
- Answer technical questions on immersion, undervolting, and tuning
- Foster an open, collaborative mining intelligence layer

## 🚀 Mission
**Empower every miner—large or small—to operate smarter, more efficient, and more resilient Bitcoin mining setups through open-source AI and community intelligence.** 

**21Hash exists not only to solve today's challenges, but to help evolve Bitcoin mining hardware, software, and infrastructure—openly, globally, and sustainably—for the next 100 years.**

**It aims to catalyze a collaborative industry effort—uniting manufacturers, operators, hobbyists, and innovators—to share knowledge, co-develop tools, and improve accessibility. By reducing reliance on closed systems and monopoly-like control, 21Hash makes mining more transparent, equitable, and aligned with the values of Bitcoin itself.**

**By encouraging open development of mining hardware and software, 21Hash opens the playing field to new, innovative products and approaches—distributing hashrate, diversifying infrastructure, and helping make the Bitcoin network more decentralized, antifragile, and globally inclusive.**
