# 21Hash

**21Hash** is an open-source AI assistant designed to support and strengthen the global Bitcoin mining community‚Äîfrom industrial-scale farms to solo pleb miners.

It learns from manuals, logs, config files, and community input to help:
- Troubleshoot mining hardware and firmware
- Optimize energy use and configurations
- Share heat reuse strategies
- Answer technical questions on immersion, undervolting, and tuning
- Foster an open, collaborative mining intelligence layer

## üöÄ Mission
**Empower every miner‚Äîlarge or small‚Äîto operate smarter, more efficient, and more resilient Bitcoin mining setups through open-source AI and community intelligence.**

**21Hash exists not only to solve today's challenges, but to help evolve Bitcoin mining hardware, software, and infrastructure‚Äîopenly, globally, and sustainably‚Äîfor the next 100 years.**

**It aims to catalyze a collaborative industry effort‚Äîuniting manufacturers, operators, hobbyists, and innovators‚Äîto share knowledge, co-develop tools, and improve accessibility. By reducing reliance on closed systems and monopoly-like control, 21Hash makes mining more transparent, equitable, and aligned with the values of Bitcoin itself.**

**By encouraging open development of mining hardware and software, 21Hash opens the playing field to new, innovative products and approaches‚Äîdistributing hashrate, diversifying infrastructure, and helping make the Bitcoin network more decentralized, antifragile, and globally inclusive.**

## üí° Why 21Hash?
- **Bitcoin-Native**: Named after Bitcoin‚Äôs 21 million hard cap
- **AI-First**: Uses GPT models, Hugging Face OSS models, and RAG pipelines to learn and improve
- **Open-Source**: Transparent, auditable, and extensible
- **Community-Driven**: Learns from real-world miner data and contributions
- **Future-Focused**: Built to inspire the long-term evolution of mining systems across the industry
- **Accessibility-Oriented**: Designed to help more people participate in mining, regardless of scale or location

## üîß Who It's For
| Group | How 21Hash Helps |
|-------|------------------|
| Large-scale miners | Optimize performance, identify issues fast, reduce costs |
| Solo/home miners | Get firmware help, setup guidance, undervolting support |
| Heat reuse miners | Improve heat capture design with shared patterns and data |
| Bitaxe/DIY devs | Share and learn from open hardware/firmware logs |
| Open-source devs | Contribute to tools, agents, and hardware/software evolution |

---

## üß† How It Learns
21Hash is designed to continuously evolve through a layered learning approach:

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Static Prompting (Now)
- Uses a pre-engineered system prompt and GPT-3.5-turbo or Hugging Face OSS model
- Answers drawn from curated mining manuals, firmware docs, and optimization guides

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Community-Driven Learning (Next)
- Logs unanswered or low-confidence questions
- Contributors submit improved responses and new data
- Expands knowledge base with real miner questions and feedback

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Operational Intelligence (Future)
- Accepts JSON logs, configuration files, and performance data
- Analyzes miner behavior, temperature, efficiency, uptime
- Adds validated insights into a searchable knowledge graph or vector database

This progressive learning loop allows 21Hash to grow smarter over time, while staying grounded in open contributions and real-world mining practices. By opening up the development of Bitcoin mining hardware and software, 21Hash helps distribute intelligence and hashrate across the global network.

## ‚ö° Model Use in Phase 1
21Hash defaults to **gpt-3.5-turbo** (via OpenAI) or **Mistral-7B Instruct** (via Hugging Face) in Phase 1. This ensures cost efficiency while providing strong answers for most Bitcoin mining questions.

- **gpt-3.5-turbo**: Fast, affordable, suitable for typical hardware, firmware, and setup Q&A.
- **Mistral-7B / Mixtral / OpenChat (Hugging Face)**: Free or low-cost OSS alternatives, good for general mining knowledge.
- **gpt-4**: Higher cost, deeper reasoning, better for complex or edge-case queries (optional for those running their own version).

We chose this setup for rapid deployment, reliability, and to encourage open-source alignment. Our intention is to transition toward **fully open-source models** in future phases to further decentralize and democratize mining intelligence.

## Using Other Models
Those deploying 21Hash from this repo are free to adjust the model configuration.

‚úÖ **OpenAI**: In `app.py`, change the `model=` parameter to your desired OpenAI model.

‚úÖ **Hugging Face**: In `app.py`, update the `api_url` value to your chosen Hugging Face Space or Inference API endpoint. If using a private Space, add your Hugging Face API token to Streamlit Secrets.

Example:
```python
api_url = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/openchat/openchat-3.5-1210"
```

This structure ensures 21Hash remains flexible for different OSS models and providers.
